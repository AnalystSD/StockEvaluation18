# StockEvaluation18
This SQL Project brings up sample stock data that may have quite the statistics to show they're potentially good investments.

This project just showcases that I'm able to apply SQL to a financial project, such as evaluation potential stock investments and much more if needed from work experience and at current job position.
The database for this script can be found in this repository, it was kindly shared by Nicholas Carbone on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cnic92/200-financial-indicators-of-us-stocks-20142018

The first chunk of code displays which stocks in a specific order to filter out null values and eratic stocks that may be abnormal or just situational outliers.

From this we can see that [UGI,VRTS,KAI,EQIX] have been brought out on top, but considering UGI and EQIX have negative "Net Cash flow / Change in cash", I'd look deeper into VRTS and KAI to see the potential returns on these investments long-term buy vs short=term buy or even buying/selling call/put options.
Also, please read the notes in the SQL code itself too.
